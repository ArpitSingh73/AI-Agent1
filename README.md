# 🧠 Smart Scheduler AI Agent

Welcome to the **Smart Scheduler AI Agent** — an interactive voice-based chatbot designed to help users find and schedule meetings through natural conversations.

## 🚀 What It Does

This project simulates a real-world AI assistant that:

- Holds intelligent, multi-turn conversations to understand a user's scheduling needs.
- Asks clarifying questions if details are missing (e.g., duration, day/time).
- Interacts with a calendar to find available time slots.
- Offers alternative suggestions when conflicts arise.
- Handles vague or complex requests like:
  - “Sometime late next week”
  - “An hour before my 5 PM meeting on Friday”
  - “Let’s do our usual sync-up”

It’s designed to sound natural, stay context-aware across turns, and provide a seamless scheduling experience—just like a human assistant would.

## 🧩 Key Highlights

- Understands and responds to spoken input.
- Remembers context (like meeting duration) across the conversation.
- Can resolve scheduling conflicts by suggesting alternatives.
- Handles ambiguous or vague scheduling requests gracefully.
- Parses complex time-based expressions with context-aware logic.
